## 🧭 About Me

I'm a 20-year-old independent researcher working at the intersection of neuroscience, brain signal processing, and reproducible computational methods.

My work focuses on:
- 🧠 **Functional neuroimaging signal modeling** (ICA, BOLD, connectivity metrics)
- 📊 **Meta-analytic methodology** across studies, features, and modalities
- 🛠 **Transparent neuroimaging toolchains**, engineered from scratch
- 🌐 **Independent architectures** for decentralized, open research

> I don't wait for permission. I build what I need to explore what matters.

## 🔬 Projects

### [NMAP-Fusion](https://github.com/NeuroMAP-Lab/NMAP-Fusion)  
> A modular framework for multi-domain, meta-analytic fusion of functional brain data.

- 📚 Registered in [PROSPERO (CRD420251044665)](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251044665)  
- 📦 Public release: [Zenodo v0.2](https://zenodo.org/records/15355619)  
- 🔧 Structural modeling logic under active development

---

### fsl-mini-arch *(coming soon)*  
> A minimalistic, open-source neuroimaging architecture reimagined from the ground up.

- 🧱 Built for reproducibility and modular clarity  
- 🗓️ Target: v0.1 (July 2025)  
- 🔒 Repo status: private (early design locked)

---

### TFSI *(coming soon)*  
> A separate automated meta-analysis pipeline — faster, more lightweight than NMAP.

---

### 🧪 Reproducible Research

All future research publications — including methodological and experimental studies — will be accompanied by open-source code and replication materials hosted under this account.

📁 Code and data for each paper will be organized in dedicated repositories.  
🔔 Stay tuned — reproducibility isn’t optional, it’s the baseline.

## 📝 Peer Review

- 🧾 Peer Reviewer @ *Frontiers* (Neuroscience & AI-related journals)  
- Reviewed 6+ manuscripts (2024–2025)  
- Topics: Functional imaging, reproducibility, computational psychiatry

> Reviewing is not gatekeeping — it’s stewardship. I review for clarity, fairness, and truth.
