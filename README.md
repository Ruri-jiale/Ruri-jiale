## 🧭 About Me

I'm a 20-year-old independent researcher working at the intersection of neuroscience, brain signal processing, genetics, and reproducible computational methods.

My work focuses on:  
- 🧠 **Functional neuroimaging signal modeling** (ICA, BOLD, connectivity metrics)  
- 📊 **Meta-analytic methodology** across studies, features, and modalities  
- 🧬 **Genetic epidemiology & causal inference** (Mendelian Randomization)  
- 🛠 **Transparent neuroimaging toolchains**, engineered from scratch  
- 🌐 **Independent architectures** for decentralized, open research

> I don't wait for permission. I build what I need to explore what matters.

## 🔬 Main Projects

### 🚀 NeuroCompass  
[![CI Status](https://github.com/Ruri-jiale/NeuroCompass/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Ruri-jiale/NeuroCompass/actions)

> 💡 A transparent, minimalistic neuroimaging “compass” for reproducible and interpretable preprocessing & modeling pipelines.  

**🚧 Status:** Core modules implemented and undergoing comprehensive testing. **v1.0 release coming soon!**

#### 🔍 Key Highlights

- **Prototype → Product**  
  – Originated as *fsl-mini-arch* during prototyping  
  – Renamed to **NeuroCompass** to reflect its role as a modular “compass”  

- **Built from Scratch**  
  – Full autonomy, no heavyweight black-box dependencies  
  – Modular design: motion correction, preprocessing interfaces, analysis chaining  

- **Quality-Driven Roadmap**  
  - 📦 Initial release complete  
  - ✅ Core motion & preprocessing modules in place  
  - 🔄 Integration & validation tests in progress  
  - 📝 Documentation & examples coming  
  - 🚀 v1.0 tagging & release pending

## 🧠 Research Ethos

> “Build quietly. Publish clearly. Defend fiercely.”  
> “Science is not a privilege — it’s a right.”  
> “If I must protect what I build, then so be it.”

🔬 *Built in resistance, for clarity in science.*  
🛡 *You may look — but you will not take.*  
💡 *Let’s build something meaningful together.*  
🚀 *Science is meant to be shared, not locked away.*
